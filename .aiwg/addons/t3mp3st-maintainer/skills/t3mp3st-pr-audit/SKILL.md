# T3MP3ST PR Audit

Use this for a single pull request before approval or merge.

## Required Context

1. Read PR metadata and current head SHA.
2. Read PR body, linked issues, comments, and reviews.
3. Fetch or check out the exact head.
4. Inspect the diff against `upstream/main`.
5. Identify changed ownership surfaces:
   - `src/server.ts`, `docs/index.html`, auth/origin/proxy/provider code,
     `src/llm/`, `src/agent/`, `src/arsenal/`, scripts, CI, installer/docs.

## Review Checklist

- Behavioral correctness: does the implementation satisfy the issue or PR claim?
- Security: no broadened auth/origin/scope/tool execution boundary without a gate.
- Local model/keyless paths: local, local-agent, codex, hosted-provider behavior
  remain distinct.
- UI/backend contract: browser payloads match server route expectations.
- Tests: regression tests match the failure mode and are not only static if runtime
  behavior changed.
- Docs: setup or operator behavior changes are documented where users see them.
- Merge readiness: current head is clean/mergeable and CI is green or equivalent
  local verification exists.

## Recommended Verification

Use the smallest meaningful set, then broaden for shared/high-risk code:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run lint
```

For targeted changes, run focused tests first but remember this repo's test script
currently runs `vitest run src`.

## Review Decision

- Approve only when the current head SHA is verified.
- Request changes for correctness/security/test gaps.
- Comment without approval when the PR is promising but stale or missing evidence.
- For maintainer-owned PRs, prefer merging after CI green rather than self-approval
  theater; record the evidence in the merge plan.

## Output

Lead with findings. If none:

```markdown
Reviewed PR #N at `<sha>`.

No blocking findings.

Verification:
- <commands/checks>

Residual risk:
- <if any>
```
