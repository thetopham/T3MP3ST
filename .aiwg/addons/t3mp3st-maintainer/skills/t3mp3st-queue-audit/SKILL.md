# T3MP3ST Queue Audit

Use this skill before any maintainer merge session. It is read-only by default.

## Inputs

- Optional PR numbers to focus on.
- Optional issue numbers to focus on.
- Operator guidance such as "find the next safe merge batch" or "focus on stale
  issue closures."

## Procedure

1. Confirm repository context:
   - `gh auth status`
   - `git status --short --branch`
   - `git remote -v`
   - ensure `upstream` is `elder-plinius/T3MP3ST`.
2. Fetch open PR metadata:
   - number, title, author, head SHA, merge state, review decision, status checks,
     last update, labels.
3. Fetch open issue metadata:
   - number, title, author, labels, comments, last update.
4. Classify PRs:
   - `ready`: clean/mergeable, CI green, audited or low-risk docs-only, no open
     requested changes.
   - `re-audit`: previously approved but stale, no current CI, force-pushed, or
     touches high-risk code.
   - `rebase-needed`: dirty/conflicted.
   - `blocked`: changes requested, failing CI, or unresolved maintainer question.
   - `unknown`: not yet inspected.
5. Classify issues:
   - `close-via-pr`: linked PR contains a closing keyword and is ready/merged.
   - `needs-response`: user needs an answer or clarification.
   - `address-issues`: concrete defect or small implementation task.
   - `feature-track`: larger design proposal needing issue/roadmap framing.
   - `defer`: not actionable yet.
6. Produce a merge train recommendation:
   - small docs/config PRs first,
   - bug fixes with closing issues next,
   - UI-only changes after related backend fixes,
   - large feature/integration PRs last.

## Output

```markdown
## T3MP3ST Queue Audit

### Ready Merge Candidates
| PR | Title | Evidence | Risk | Suggested Order |

### Needs Re-audit
| PR | Reason | Required Checks |

### Blocked / Rebase Needed
| PR | Blocker | Maintainer Action |

### Issue Actions
| Issue | Class | Next Action |
```

## Guardrails

- Do not merge during this skill unless the operator explicitly asks.
- Do not close issues unless the closure evidence is current and explicit.
- Treat old approvals as stale when the head SHA changed.
- Treat no-check PRs as unverified until local tests or CI evidence exists.
