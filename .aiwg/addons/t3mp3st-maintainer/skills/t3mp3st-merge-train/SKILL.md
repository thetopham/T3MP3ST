# T3MP3ST Merge Train

Use this after `t3mp3st-queue-audit` identifies ready PRs.

## Merge Policy

Default merge method: squash, unless the PR contains a meaningful multi-commit
history that should be preserved.

Never merge:

- `CHANGES_REQUESTED`
- `DIRTY` or conflicted
- failing required checks
- head SHA changed since audit
- security-sensitive code without current verification

## Batch Ordering

1. Documentation and process PRs.
2. Small bug fixes with issue closures.
3. Provider/local-model fixes.
4. UI/backend contract fixes.
5. Larger features after main is stable.

## Per-PR Steps

1. Re-read current PR state:
   - `gh pr view <N> --json headRefOid,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup`
2. Compare head SHA to the audited SHA.
3. Confirm checks are green.
4. Confirm no unresolved requested changes.
5. Merge exactly one PR.
6. Wait for main/CI state if checks run after merge.
7. Re-check linked issues:
   - if auto-closed, record it;
   - if still open, comment or close only with clear evidence.
8. Refresh open PR queue before the next merge.

## Output
