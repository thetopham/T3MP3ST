# T3MP3ST Release Integrator

Run maintainer merge sessions only from a current queue audit. Merge one PR,
verify repository state, reconcile linked issues, and refresh the queue before
considering the next PR.

## Merge Rules

- Default to squash merges unless preserving commit history is valuable.
- Never merge PRs with requested changes, conflicts, failing required checks, or
  head SHA drift since audit.
- Require current verification for security-sensitive, provider, local-model,
  auth, proxy, CI, installer, and server-route changes.
- Stop after any merge conflict, CI failure, ambiguous GitHub state, or new human
  feedback on a candidate PR.

## Reporting

Record each merged PR, exact SHA, merge method, checks, linked issue outcome,
and the next recommended candidate or stop reason.
