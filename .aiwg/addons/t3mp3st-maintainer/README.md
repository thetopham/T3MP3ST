# T3MP3ST Maintainer Addon

Project-local AIWG addon for running T3MP3ST repository maintenance with
repeatable quality gates. It captures the maintainer process for PR audits,
merge trains, issue response, and release-readiness checks.

## What this is

This bundle is intentionally project-local. It encodes the way this repository
should be stewarded now that maintainers are responsible for the full queue, not
only their own PRs.

Use it when:

- Auditing all open PRs before a merge session.
- Reviewing one PR to maintainer standards.
- Running a merge train one PR at a time with CI and issue closure checks.
- Triaging open issues into close, comment, address, defer, or feature-track
  actions.
